# Sample project

## Setup project

First, make sure you already have Git installed on your computer and a GitHub account

<!-- more -->

To check git is installed:

```bash
git --version
```

If this is the first time you use git, you need to set a git username and git email, you can remove the —global flag if you want to set a user name and user email for a specific repository:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Check you already set the git user name and user email:

```bash
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```

You need to create a repository in GitHub, let's give it a git-workflow-example name.

![Untitled](../../assets/Git%20workflow%2016d1a589e8024abc8e064c1d19034e58/Untitled.png)

Tick at the “Add a README file” option. Let all remaining setting is default then click the ‘Create repository’ button.

![Untitled](../../assets/Git%20workflow%2016d1a589e8024abc8e064c1d19034e58/Untitled%201.png)

Save the link to the repository, you will need it later, with this tutorial, we will use HTTPS.

In the upper left, click on the branch button.

Click on the View All branch.

Click new branch, naming branch is staging, source is main.

Go to setting → Branches → Add rule.

Create two sets of rules for main and staging, with the following rule chosen:

- Require a pull request before merging.
- Require status checks to pass before merging.
    - Require branches to be up to date before merging.

![Untitled](../../assets/Git%20workflow%2016d1a589e8024abc8e064c1d19034e58/Untitled%202.png)

These rules make sure our project follows the git workflow.

Open the terminal in your computer, clone the repository you have just created then change the directory to it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/git-workflow-example.git
cd git-workflow-example
```

## Create new feature

### Add hello world line

In this example, the image you are given the task of adding “Hello World!” to the README.md file

Before starting, we need to have the staging branch in the local repository:

```bash
git switch staging
```

First, we need to create a new branch for this feature:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/adding-hello-world-line staging
```

Add a line to README.md:

```bash
printf "\n" >> README.md
echo "Hello World!" >> README.md
```

Commit the current workspace to the local repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(hello-world): add hello world file"
```

Create a new branch and push your change to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin -u feature/adding-hello-world-line
```

This may ask you for credentials if this is the first time you are using Git, you can follow [this](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.6/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) to create a GitHub personal access token to identify.

Notice: GitHub removed Support for password authentication on August 13, 2021.

Before identifying, you can run this to avoid entering credentials multiple times:

```bash
git config credential.helper store
```

Go to your project in GitHub and create a Pull Request. Changing base branch to staging.

![Untitled](../../assets/Git%20workflow%2016d1a589e8024abc8e064c1d19034e58/Untitled%203.png)

In practice, you will receive some reviews from others. For now, merge the new branch to staging then delete it.

![Untitled](../../assets/Git%20workflow%2016d1a589e8024abc8e064c1d19034e58/Untitled%204.png)

### Add release GitHub action

This time, you are given to add GitHub action to release a new version whenever the staging branch is merged to the main branch.

If you want to know more about GitHub action, try visiting [this](https://github.com/features/actions).

Create a new feature branch:

```bash
git checkout staging
git pull
git checkout -b feature/add-release-action
```

The branch *feature/adding-hello-world-line has been merged to staging, so you can delete it:*

```bash
git branch -d feature/adding-hello-world-line
```

To create a GitHub action, first let’s create a .github folder, create a workflows folder in .github:

```bash
mkdir .github && cd $_
mkdir workflows && cd $_
```

In the workflows folder, create a file name release.yml and give the file permission to edit content:

```bash
touch release.yml
chmod +w release.yml
```

You can use any editor you want, this tutorial will use vim to change file content.

Open file with vim:

```bash
vim release.yml
```

Paste the content below to release.yml:

```yaml
name: release
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths-ignore:
      - '*.md'
env:
  REGISTRY: ghcr.io
  ORG_USERNAME: ${{ github.actor }}

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  packages: write

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      build: ${{ steps.release.outputs.release_created }}
      tag_name: ${{ steps.release.outputs.tag_name }}
    steps:
      - uses: google-github-actions/release-please-action@v3
        id: release
        with:
          release-type: simple
          pull-request-header: 'Bot (:robot:) requested to create a new release on ${{ github.ref_name }}'
```

Entering ****:wq**** to save and close the file.

Commit the change and push the new feature branch to the remote repo:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(github action): implement github action for release"
git push origin -u feature/add-release-action
```

Go to GitHub, create and merge a pull request of the new branch to staging.

![Untitled](../../assets/Git%20workflow%2016d1a589e8024abc8e064c1d19034e58/Untitled%205.png)

To GitHub action can release a new version in your repository, you need to allow action can create and approve pull requests.

Go to the settings of your repository. 

Go to Action > General, and tick “Allow GitHub Actions can create pull requests or submit approving pull request reviews” at the end of the page. Save the setting.

![Untitled](../../assets/Git%20workflow%2016d1a589e8024abc8e064c1d19034e58/Untitled%206.png)

Okay, now GitHub action will auto-release a new version of our app whenever any branch merges with the main branch.

### Release new version

It may need more features, and more processes to merge code from staging to main and release a new version. In this tutorial, simply create a pull request and merge staging to the main.

![Untitled](../../assets/Git%20workflow%2016d1a589e8024abc8e064c1d19034e58/Untitled%207.png)

The GitHub action will create new pull request with information about our new release, and merge it to the main.

![Untitled](../../assets/Git%20workflow%2016d1a589e8024abc8e064c1d19034e58/Untitled%208.png)

You have just finished creating a new version using the git workflow. The CHANGELOG.md file contains information on our releases.

## Hotfix and Bugfix

### About the problem

Image your co-worker’s release a new version containing a script to automate adding a new line to the content of the README.md file.

The expected render result is.

![Untitled](../../assets/Git%20workflow%2016d1a589e8024abc8e064c1d19034e58/Untitled%2010.png)

Let's see [the repository](https://github.com/TickLabVN/git-workflow).

![Untitled](../../assets/Git%20workflow%2016d1a589e8024abc8e064c1d19034e58/Untitled%2011.png)

Oop! The rendered result is different from what we expected.

### Fork repository

In this section, we will fix this bug using git-workflow. Because we don’t have permission to directly modify this repository, we will fork this repository to change, push, and create pull requests.

Click the “Fork” button in the upper right, and give it a new name *********git-workflow-sample********* to distinguish the one you created above. Let all remaining setting is the default.

Clone the new repository we have just forked to make some changes in that code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-user-name/git-workflow-sample.git
cd git-workflow-sample
```

### Hotfix branch

The first thing we need to do when my newest code has wrong behavior is to recover as fast as possible so that users can remain using our service.

See the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/TickLabVN/git-workflow/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to know more details about your co-worker’s release.

![Untitled](../../assets/Git%20workflow%2016d1a589e8024abc8e064c1d19034e58/Untitled%2012.png)

We will make a new hotfix branch back to version 1.0.0 before your co-worker's script is added to let the user continue using our service:

```bash
git checkout -b 'hotfix/back-to-before-newline-script-is-added' main
```

See the history of commits:

```bash
git log
```

![Untitled](../../assets/Git%20workflow%2016d1a589e8024abc8e064c1d19034e58/Untitled%2013.png)

We will revert the code to version 1.0.0 is released:

```bash
git revert -m 1 --no-commit 9cb11c..HEAD
```

Let's see the content of README.md:

```bash
cat README.md
```

Continue revert the code:

```bash
git revert --continue
```

An editor will show, by default, it will be nano, press Ctrl + O → Enter → Ctrl + X to save and out of the editor.

Push our change to the remote repository and create a new pull request:

```bash
git push -u origin hotfix/back-to-before-newline-script-is-added
```

This will create a hotfix/back-to-before-newline-script-is-added branch in your remote repository and push your code to this branch.

Create pull requests to the main and staging branches. Our user can continue using our service after your pull request is approved and merged.

![Untitled](../../assets/Git%20workflow%2016d1a589e8024abc8e064c1d19034e58/Untitled%2014.png)

### Bugfix branch

After making a hotfix to keep our service still working, we need to make deep remediation to root the problem and avoid it happening again in the future.

It seems the newline script is overwritten instead of appending the newline to it, let's see the script in detail and fix the problem.

The image of the hotfix branch you have just created is approved and merged with the main and staging branch. Following the git workflow, you will create a bug fix branch from the staging branch, but for now, we make a new bugfix branch from the hotfix branch.

Make sure you are currently in the hotfix branch:

```bash
git checkout 'hotfix/back-to-before-newline-script-is-added'
```

Create a new bugfix branch:

```bash
git checkout -b 'bugfix/let-newline-script-append-newline-to-README.md-file'
```

Revert branch to the script is done by your co-worker:

```bash
git revert --no-commit 4c5be7..HEAD
```

First, recover the content of README.md:

```bash
echo "# git-workflow

Hello World!" > README.md
```

See the current content of README.md:

```bash
cat README.md
```

![Untitled](../../assets/Git%20workflow%2016d1a589e8024abc8e064c1d19034e58/Untitled%2015.png)

Then see the content of newline.sh:

```bash
cat newline.sh
```

![Untitled](../../assets/Git%20workflow%2016d1a589e8024abc8e064c1d19034e58/Untitled%2016.png)

Notice in the “append the new text to the file” section, your co-worker used ‘>’, the operator will overwrite the content of the file. Try changing it to the ‘>>’ operator to see if it resolves the problem.

Give [newline.sh](http://newline.sh) file permission to write and execute:

```bash
chmod +x+w newline.sh
```

Open file with Vim:

```bash
vim newline.sh
```

Enter i to access insert mode, change > to >> operator

Press the “Esc” then type :wq to save the change, and close the file.

Execute the script and see if it works as we expect:

```bash
./newline.sh
```

See content of README.md:

```bash
cat README.md
```

![Untitled](../../assets/Git%20workflow%2016d1a589e8024abc8e064c1d19034e58/Untitled%2017.png)

Nice, now the script works correctly.

Commit the change, and push it to the remote repository.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'fix(newline.sh): replace > by >> to let newline is append to exist README.md content'
git push -u origin bugfix/let-newline-script-append-newline-to-README.md-file
```

Create a pull request to merge your change to the staging branch

![Untitled](../../assets/Git%20workflow%2016d1a589e8024abc8e064c1d19034e58/Untitled%2018.png)

Good job! You have just completely debugged a problem with the git workflow
